# Rent-Predictor
In today’s uncertain economy, many individuals and families face financial challenges when trying to secure housing. This tool was built to help renters get a clearer idea of how much they might expect to pay based on their needs and the city they’re in — without any financial barrier. 
Tools like this should be accessible to everyone, and not locked behind paywalls or exclusive platforms. Use it freely to make more informed and confident decisions when looking for a place to live.
